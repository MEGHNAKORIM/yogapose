A schematic diagram for the Automated Computer Vision System for Food Waste Detection and Quantification would likely illustrate the following components and their interactions:

Camera(s): Represented as a lens or camera symbol, showing the capture of images of food waste on a tray or in a disposal area. Arrows would indicate the field of view.
Image Input: An arrow leading from the camera to the next stage, representing the transfer of the captured image data.
Processing Unit: A rectangle or box labeled "Image Processing Unit" or "Computer Vision System." This unit would contain sub-blocks representing:
Deep Learning Model (Food Segmentation & Recognition): A block showing the AI algorithm (e.g., "Mask R-CNN Model").
Food Classification: A block indicating the categorization of identified food items (e.g., "CNN Classifier").
Portion Size Estimation: A block showing the calculation of initial food quantity (e.g., "Volume Estimation Module").
Waste Quantification: A block comparing pre- and post-consumption images (e.g., "Waste Calculation Module").
Data Storage: A cylinder or database symbol labeled "Food Waste Data," with arrows indicating the flow of processed data from the Processing Unit.
Output/User Interface: A monitor or screen symbol labeled "User Interface" or "Dashboard," showing the presentation of the analyzed data (e.g., reports, charts, trends). Arrows would indicate the flow of data from the Data Storage to the User Interface.
Optional Integrations: Dashed lines or arrows might show potential connections to:
Kitchen Management System.
Waste Management System.
Network/Cloud Connectivity.
